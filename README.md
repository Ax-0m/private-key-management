# Private Key Management System

A secure and user-friendly system for managing private keys, built with React, TypeScript, and Solana Web3 integration.

## Why This Project?

In the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency, private key management is a critical challenge. This project addresses several key problems:

1. **Security Concerns**: Traditional methods of storing private keys (like text files or paper wallets) are vulnerable to theft and loss.
2. **User Experience**: Managing private keys manually is complex and error-prone for non-technical users.
3. **Transaction Safety**: Signing transactions requires secure handling of private keys and proper validation.
4. **Accessibility**: There's a need for a user-friendly interface to manage blockchain transactions.

## How It Works

### Core Functionality

1. **User Management**
   - Secure user registration and authentication
   - Automatic key pair generation for new users
   - Secure storage of public-private key pairs
   - JWT-based session management

2. **Transaction Handling**
   - Secure SOL (Solana) transfer functionality
   - Transaction signing with private keys
   - Real-time balance checking
   - Transaction status monitoring

3. **Security Features**
   - Private keys are never exposed to the frontend
   - All sensitive operations happen on the backend
   - Encrypted storage of private keys
   - Input validation and sanitization

### Technical Architecture

#### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- Modern, responsive UI for transaction management
- Real-time balance checking
- Transaction status updates
- Secure communication with backend
- Integration with Solana Web3.js for blockchain interaction

#### Backend (Node.js + Express)
- RESTful API endpoints for all operations
- Secure private key management
- Transaction signing and broadcasting
- MongoDB integration for user data
- JWT-based authentication system

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Solana Web3.js
- Axios for API communication
- Modern CSS with responsive design

### Backend
